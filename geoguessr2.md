Description:

`Our history class recently took a walk on a field trip here. Where is this? Flag format: Use three decimal points of precision and round. The last digit of the first coordinate is EVEN, and the last digit of the second coordinate is ODD. Example: LITCTF{80.438,-23.497} (no spaces)`

Like geoguessr1, we will follow the same methodology to find the location.

Upon uploading to the images.google.com website, we found a name: `Captain John Parker`. The image provided to us might be of Captain John Parker's cemetery. We see some similar images also.

There is one uploaded on X (Twitter). From there, we learn that the cemetery is in Lexington's Old Burying Ground.

Using Google Maps, we get the coordinates.

The coordinates: (42.45055819432616, -71.23324067709615)

Formating as mentioned in the description, the flag is: `LITCTF{42.450,-71.233}`
